Welcome to a demo of Zwielicht, a parser game, where you type in phrases and words that will determine
the in-game character's actions. All actions are NOT case sensitive.
There is one available character dialogue interaction, to the WEST of the starting area.
Once you start the encounter, you won't be able to explore until it's finished, so explore around
a bit first if you'd like (or not, whatever floats your boat, player).
For a list of standard commands, type COMMANDS.
