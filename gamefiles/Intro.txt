In the MiM headquarters, a branch of the FABLE (Federation of the Arcane, Beasts, and Legends), 
two beings are engaged in a seemingly endless back and forth, professionalism be damned.

Perched atop the human-like's shoulder, the raven crows out:
"Honestly, Sibyl shoulda just told him herself! I mean what's stopping her?"

"Aw, c'mon Huginn, you know we owe her a favor after she saved our skin last time," you reply. 

Huginn contemplates that for a bit, then concedes. 
"Fine, I'll admit, if it wasn't for her and that serpent we'd still be eternally falling in Ginnungagap now."

"See? This is just a little favor, plus we're all excited she found it, right? 
Don't forget what I told you to do. We really don't need you provoking Fenrir, after what happened
last time."

Saying nothing, Huginn merely waves a wing in assent.
(This what you were saying when you wanted me to: "Keep quiet, at least in the physical plane")
(And seriously, "physical plane"? You've been listening to Matthias's ramblings one too many times.)

He's got a point, honestly. Hearing a guy talk about planes of existence and metaphysics almost 
daily has serious downsides.

After a few more minutes of walking (and a shortlived debate about the existence of parallel universes), 
the two of you arrive at the West Hallway, going further west is Edelmar's Office. Your destination for 
this errand. Relaying the message isn't really that urgent, but it is information Edelmar will definitely 
want to know about. 

(So, what'll it be? Straight into the wolf's maw? Or we checking out some other stuff first?)
