An old-looking, but well-kept hunting dagger gifted to you by Edelmar. 
(It's called a Hirschf√§nger, deer catcher, if you will. Nobles love their fancy hunts, 
makes sense El's family would own one of these lovely specimens.) The scabbard it comes in 
exudes the aura of being expensive. For a dagger, it has a fair bit of reach, might be a 
new addition to your arsenal after all. Though, the handle's a bit flashy for your tastes.

It's Fenrir's dog bed. Comfortable and lavish. Edelmar really doesn't spare any expense.
It's got rips here and there, looks well worn. (I think that gives it character don't
you think?)

You're slightly baffled with the amount of frankly, lethal weapons on display here. On 
the other hand, considering who owns this place, it's not that shocking anymore. Front 
and center, there lies the famed Gleipnir. Said to have chained Fenrir-
(The one sitting right there, I might add, so I'd advise against doing anything rash)
-until the end of the gods. Really, picturing the (fairly) docile wolf nestled in the corner
as a devourer of gods.

(Edelmar says Gleipnir stays displayed as a reminder for everyone working here).

Other than the two Huginn's pointed out, you can see even more intriguing death-dealing
instruments. Beside the morning star, there's an oddly curved blade that's knife-sized. 
(That one's a Kukri, ever heard of it?) Up above (HOW DID YOU NOT SEE THIS IMMEDIATELY?), 
a mounted scythe, with an expertly carved handle that looked painstaking to create.

A painting of an ancient looking noblewoman. Seems like it's one of Edelmar's ancestors.
She certainly looks like him, anyways. If the green eyes and  didn't give it away, then the 
insignia on her lapel--bearing the Voigt family coat of arms--clearly do.
