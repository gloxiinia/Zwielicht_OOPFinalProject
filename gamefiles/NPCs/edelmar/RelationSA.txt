"Ah, before I forget again. I've been meaning to gift you this since your last successful mission."

El moves towards one of the larger display cabinets and procures an elegant bladed weapon.

"A hunting dagger, I believe it was my brother's." He looks a bit wistful, saying that.

"I would be remiss to not acknowledge your capabilities. I trust you'll show this beauty her fair share of battle."

As he hands the dagger to you, he adds: 

"Of course, I also thank you. For being a friend."

You've received a hunting dagger from Edelmar. Check your inventory for a closer look.
